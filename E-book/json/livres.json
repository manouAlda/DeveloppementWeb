The fast-paced action will have readers gasping for the upcoming sequel.” — Booklist\n\n“A cross between The Hunger Games (minus the bloodsport) and The Bachelor (minus the bloodsport), this trilogy launch is a lot of fun. Cass deftly builds the chemistry between America and Maxon, while stroking the embers of America’s first, forbidden love.” — Publishers Weekly\n\n“Reality T.V. meets dystopian fairy tale in Kiera Cass’s delightful debut. Charming, captivating, and filled with just the right amount of swoon!” — Kiersten White, New York Times bestselling author of Paranormalcy\n-",
